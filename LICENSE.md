copy of the Program in return for a fee.

DOMLauncher: An Android home replacement application that loads in custom user interfaces that are written with web technologies. Included plugins fall under the DOMLauncher umbrella and are not separate from the application.

Plugins and/or Source Code: Custom written Java that expands the out of box functionality of Cordova, this does not include the majority of usage needs required of a home replacement application. This includes the JavaScript call wrappers for easier usage of the DOMLauncher API.

DOMod:   DOMod: Also known as a DOMod Interface, DMD and DMDi.  All are terms for a custom user interface that is loaded into DOMLauncher.   These interfaces can also be referenced as a framework or toolkit.  DOMods maintain their own individual terms and conditions as a DOMod is separate from DOMLauncher.

For-Profit: Any person(s), group(s) or legal entity who, through their routine process, uses, hosts or are to directly distributes DOMLauncher or any affiliated code that generates revenue from DOMLauncher or associated services. In order to utilize DOMLauncher in such an environment or as a part of an internal corporate environment one should contact: licensing@domlauncher.com

Single Shot Launcher: Is a modified version of DOMLauncher that includes a singular internal DOMod. A Single Shot does not load additional DOMods. The single DMD would maintain a singular environment tailored to its intended purpose. The Single Shot would be branded as a separate app entity from DOMLauncher while attributing base code to the DOMLauncher Project.
